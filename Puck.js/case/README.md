Puck.js cases
=============

## Bottom (ABS plastic)

* [`bottom.stl`](bottom.stl) is the STL file for the ABS plastic Puck.js case. `bottom.stp` is the STEP design file.
* [`bottom_no_attachment.stl`](bottom_no_attachment.stl) is a version that doesn't have the 'attachment' point on the rear (it's just a full circle)
* [`bottom_button_holder.stl`](bottom_button_holder.stl) has protrusions inside that hold the Puck.js button in place, and will stop any rotation you may experience on Puck.js v2. It also doesn't have the 'attachment' point on the rear.


## Top (Silicone)

[`top.stl`](top.stl) is the STL file for the silicone Puck.js case. `top.stp` is the STEP design file.
