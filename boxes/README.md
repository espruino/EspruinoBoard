3D Printable Mounts and Boxes
=========================

Here are some boxes and holders for Espruino that you can print.

They are in [OpenSCAD](http://www.openscad.org/) format which means that they can be easily tweaked to different sizes.

STL files can be generated by running `make` in this directory. 

gcode files can be generated by saving a slic3r configuration as `slicer.ini` 
in this directory and then running `make gcode`


## Espruino version < 1.4

**BEWARE:** These have been designed on a 3D printer that is not totally calibrated, and as such could do with some adjustment before printing. Please feel free to contribute back your changes and designs.

## Espruino 1.4
As Espruino 1.4 moved USB and power around a bit, be sure to print this case if you own 1.4. You can easily look it up below the large Espruino silk screen label on your board.

Ultimaker 2, PLA, standard quality, 250* nozze, 60* plate

This makes for a very tight fit which is what I wanted for this application, expand INNER_WIDTH if you want a looser fit in the case.


## Espruino Cover
This cover is parameterized so you can adapt it to your version of espruino_box.

### espruino_cover.scad

It slides in on the back of the espruino_cover like this:
